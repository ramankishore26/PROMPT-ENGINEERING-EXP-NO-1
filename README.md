**🦇 "Benny the Bat Who Was Afraid of the Dark"**

Benny was not like other bats.
All the bats in Batville loved the night — they flapped, swooped, and played tag in the cool moonlight.
But Benny?
Benny didn’t like the dark.
In fact… he was *afraid* of it.

Every evening, when the sun dipped behind the trees and the sky turned deep blue, Benny would snuggle into his little leaf bed and whisper,
“Maybe I’ll just sleep through the night and wake up when it’s sunny again.”

The other bats would giggle kindly. “Come on, Benny! The stars are twinkling, the moon is smiling, and there are tasty moths for dinner!”
But Benny would shake his head. “It’s too dark! What if I can’t see where I’m going? What if something scary is out there?”

One night, Benny’s best friend, Luna, had an idea.
“Let’s go just a *little* outside,” she said. “I’ll be with you the whole time.”

So, Benny peeked his nose out of the cave. The sky was sprinkled with stars like tiny lanterns.
“Whoa,” whispered Benny. “It’s… not so bad.”

They flew a little farther. The moon hung in the sky like a big, silver balloon.
“It’s beautiful,” Benny said, eyes wide.

Then he heard a sound — *chirp, chirp, chirp!* Benny froze.
“Is it a monster?!” he squeaked.
Luna laughed. “No, Benny — that’s just cricket music!”
Benny listened. The crickets were singing, the frogs were humming, and the wind was whistling softly through the trees.

The dark wasn’t empty at all — it was full of gentle sounds and sparkly lights.
For the first time, Benny felt… curious.

They flew together under the moon, chasing fireflies that flickered like tiny stars. Benny laughed so hard he forgot to be scared.

From then on, Benny still liked sunshine — but he also looked forward to the night.
Because the dark wasn’t scary anymore… it was magical.

And every night, before flying into the starry sky, Benny would whisper to himself:
“Hello, darkness. I’m glad you’re here.”

**The End.** 🌙✨
